# angular-boilerplate

## Clean Coding Pratices

* Small methods. (10 lines of code or less)

* Proper naming.

* Single responsability.

* TO DO:
    * Improve service requests. The HttpClient abstraction of the Angular has not been well studied, it may be wrong.
    * Terminate testing of the implementation of Angular HttpClient.
    * Retest interceptor tests. When updated to Angular 6 an exception occurred showing
    that one of the tests did the validation undefined = undefined.
    * Upgrade to version 6.
    * Create generic components.
